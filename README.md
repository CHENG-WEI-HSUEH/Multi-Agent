# Multi-Agent
## Swarm Intelligence for Flight Scheduling
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Agents (particles) move around in the search space following simple mathematical formulae over their position and velocity.
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): Agents (ants) simulate the way ants find the shortest path from their colony to food sources.
## Coordination and Cooperation Algorithms
- Decentralized Cooperative Algorithms: Agents share information and resources to achieve a common goal without a central control.
- Task Allocation: Dynamic allocation of tasks among agents based on their capabilities and task requirements.
